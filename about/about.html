                    <p>
                        Yep, we've made advances. But we're not truly an interplanetary species just yet (we've only just landed on Mars). And that's our real mission: to make the expanses of space accessible to humans. And one of the first steps in that direction is awareness. By offering tours of space, we hope to make the ideal of expansion through space a reality. Ultimately, the expansion of humanity throughout the solar system and eventually the galaxy is what we're trying to bring about. Through our tours, we lay bare the importance of space and open up the idea of space exploration to the people of the world to finally achieve a life beyond Earth.

                          The idea for Odyssey began to take shape in 2022, and Odyssey was formally incorporated in 2023 by a group
                          of entrepreneurs who were passionate about space exploration and the potential for space tourism.
                          We saw an opportunity to create a new industry that would allow people to experience the thrill of space
                          travel without having to be trained astronauts. All of us had a vision of making space tourism accessible
                          to everyone, not just the wealthy elite. We were also determined to uphold high safety standards
                          and earn a reputation for being reliable and honest.

                          After navigating a complex web of regulations and safety requirements, we launched our first tour, the
                          WorldWide tour, in 2026. The Zenith tour followed two years later, in 2028, after we struck a deal
                          with SpaceX. The ISS tour, our latest tour, was launched in 2029. We sent our first official astronaut to
                          space in 2029 on our first ISS tour. Since 2026, we've sent over 97,000 people to space, on a spotless record
                          that is not marred by even a single mishap or accident. This year alone, 2032, we aim to hit our first
                          milestone of a 100,000 people sent to space.

                          Since our humble beginnings in 2023 and the launch of our first tour in 2026, we've grown to become
                          the leader in an industry which we helped pioneer. Odyssey turned a profit for the first time in 2029 and
                          grossed over $20 billion in revenue. Our net worth is estimated at approximately $125 billion dollars,
                          and we employ over 5,000 people. Besides just tours, Odyssey also provides official services by sending
                          NASA astronauts to space, the moon, and even Mars. We're a company doing a lot, but one thing that unites
                          all of us is our passion for space.

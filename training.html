                At Odyssey, we consider your safety to be of utmost importance. While we don't expect you to become experienced astronauts before taking the trip, we do require that you are familiar with basic skills in face of an emergency.
                The goal of each class in the training regimen is to prepare you for your tour and uplift your confidence so you can enjoy the journey of a lifetime.

            <p class="mb-2" >
                Training involves both hands-on and in-class learning. The training regimen is built to take 3 to 10 days to complete, depending on your tour. Our training classes are taught by dedicated, trained, and certified staff with at least 3 years of flight experience. You must take part in all the prerequisite classes in order to fly, along with being cleared medically for the flight. Consult the chart below for specifics and to learn what classes you will need to take.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2" >
                Odyssey training centers are spread out over all major cities in the US, along with some international locations as well. You will choose your personal training schedule and center after registration. For those who would like them, additional training resources, such as retaking a class, are available free of charge, based on Odyssey instructor availability and tour dates. If you have any questions, please contact us immediately.

                              While Odyssey has not as of yet had even a single life-threatening situation develop on its tours, emergencies can happen at any time, and it's crucial to have the skills and knowledge to know what to do then. While onboard a tour, you can have two kinds of emergencies: medical, wherein the pilot or a fellow passenger is affected, or orbital, which includes failure of mechanical systems on the vehicle you're using.

                              For onboard emergencies, such as failure of navigation or life support systems or a loss of pressure, you'll learn how to turn on backup systems, communicate with ground control, and otherwise be prepared for such an eventuality. For medical emergencies, you'll learn how to assess and treat a range of common injuries and illnesses, from cuts and burns to fractures and sprains. You'll also learn how to recognize the signs of more serious medical conditions, such as heart attacks and strokes, and how to respond effectively to these emergencies.

This is meant to be a basic introduction to launched spaceflight, i.e., with rockets involved, unlike a conventional plane as with the WorldWideTM tour. This class will discuss terminology and the science behind, well, rocket science, and also allow passengers on these tours to gain a deeper understanding of rocket-lashed spaceflight.

It will also go into depth about experiences specific to rockets, such as the G-forces you will have to face during launch and reentry and how recovery differs from the WorldWide&#8482; tour.
